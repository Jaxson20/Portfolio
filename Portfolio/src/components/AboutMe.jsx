      <p> Hi, my name is Jaxson Fellhauer, and I am 18 years old. I am a recent High School graduate, and I am currently studying programming at KU. I like to hang out with my friends, play sports, and watch movies. My goals for the future are to get a job in programming and maybe go back to college after I finish this bootcamp.</p>
